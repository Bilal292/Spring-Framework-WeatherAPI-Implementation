# MyWeather App 


features in the app:

1. **City Forecast:** Given a city name, give its forecast.
2. **Daylight Hours Comparison:** Given two city names, compare the length of the daylight hours between them and return the city with the longest day. In this context, "daylight hours" means the time between sunrise and sunset.
3. **Rain Check:** Given two city names, check which city it is currently raining in.

The codebase is a Java application built with the Spring framework. It includes a `WeatherController` class where I can add new features.
